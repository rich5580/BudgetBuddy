# Reason For Designing Application:
This project was done for a group project at Wilfrid Laurier for CP470 (Android Programming).
We were tasked to create an application using Android Studio.

# How To Run:
You need to have Android Studio to run this application.
1. Once you have launched this application, a login screen will get displayed.
2. Before you can use the application, you must register an account.
3. Once you have registered an account, it will take you back to the login screen, so that you can login
4. Now login

# Features
Incorporated:
- A personalized questionnaire depending on the type of individual you are
- A complete budget-management system including abilities to add individual spending
- View a high-level summary of recurring spending as determined by the personalized questionnaire
- Manipulate/add/delete individual spending data
- View totals and summaries of spending
- Combined totals and summaries display to the user their overall spending
- Support for multiple user accounts with a log in/log out function

# Project Deliverables:
1. Beta version of the application
2. Testing and documentation of code
3. Video demo of application and its functionality.

# Project Benefits:
- Experience with Android Studio

# Project Risks: 
1. Technical difficulties
2. This is our first Android app, and the team lacks expertise
3. Time constraints due to other ongoing work and a hard deadline

# Project Milestones: 
- Functional beta version of app: December 6, 2021
- Testing and documentation completed: December 7,2021
- Slides completed: December 7, 2021
- Video demo of application: December 8, 2021
